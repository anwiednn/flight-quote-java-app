# Flight Quote Java console app

Simple console application Java.

This console application simulates to call three different flight sites to retrieve flight quotes in an async workflow.

It uses `Thread.sleep` to simulate calls made to an imaginary flight sites (API).

Furthermore it uses a random number for the thread sleep timeout and flight price to give a more random output of retrieved flight quotes.

It outputs information using `System.out.printLn`.
